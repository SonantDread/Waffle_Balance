# Waffle_Balance
A balance mod for King Arthur's Gold that attempts to make the game faster paced and more enjoyable and adds features/mechanics to less used items

DISCLAIMER: Developed without compatibility with other mods in mind, so there's a decent chance it will conflict with any mod that changes base game scripts. Partly due to how KAG mods things partly due to that I'm lazy and there's no way to fully disconnect things
